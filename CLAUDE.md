# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is right now

**TrackBit School** — the unified school product: an *Academic Health Layer* + Tasks + Fees in one
app. It answers one question no ERP answers: *"Is my school actually teaching well, right now?"* It
sits **beside** the school's existing ERP; it does not replace it.

The spec lives in `docs/` (also mirrored at the repo root):

- `trackbit-school-prd-v1.md` — **SPRD v1.0**, the build spec (modules, domain model, endpoints,
  screens, packets, Done-when gates). This is the primary implementation guide.
- `trackbit-product-architecture.md` — **v1.1**, the "why": positioning, product principles, and the
  fences (what we deliberately do *not* build).

Cite the spec in code comments as `SPRD §x.y`. **Conflict order:** the architecture doc's principles
and fences win over the PRD; an explicit later founder decision wins over both.

## Build status (what exists now)

**P0 (foundation) is complete**, verified against real Postgres (backend suite **143 passing**,
ruff clean; web tsc + eslint + `next build` clean). Migration head = **`d3f4a5b6c7d8`**.

- **P0-A** — `api/` + `web/` seeded from the task_management2 seed; `docs/`; AI (§8) + WhatsApp (§7)
  config stubs; monorepo git.
- **P0-B** — roles `admin`(Director)/`coordinator`/`teacher`/`office` (`member`→`teacher` migration);
  `core/roles.py` groups; `require_coordinator_up`/`require_academic`/`require_office_up`;
  role-aware nav + `landingForRole`; Members UI on 4 roles.
- **P0-C** — master data (§4.2): `models/academics.py` + `models/students.py` (8 org-scoped+RLS
  tables), `AcademicService`/`StudentService`, 19 endpoints under `/academics` + `/students`;
  frontend `/academics` setup + `/students` (ST-1/ST-2); **roster xlsx importer** (heuristic
  mapping, `roster_import.py`, `/students/import/*`, FE-5).
- **P0-D** — fee port (§4.6): `fee_math.py` (ported money math), `models/fees.py` (5 tables),
  `FeeService`, 11 endpoints under `/fees` (all `require_office_up`).
- **P0-E** — fee frontend: `/fees` (summary + list + enrol), `/fees/[id]` (pay/undo/discount +
  ledger), `/fees/structures`; global year switcher (`year-context` + `YearSwitcher`).

**P1 (Planner + Classroom Log) is in progress** — migration head **`d6c7d8e9fab0`**:
- **P1-A** — `CalendarEvent` + `academic_years.working_weekdays`; `services/calendar.py`
  effective-teaching-days engine; `/academics/calendar/*`; web `/planner` (PL-1).
- **P1-B/C** — `models/planner.py` (syllabus_units/topics, plans, plan_entries); `PlannerService`
  (greedy `distribute`, heuristic `split_text`, draft/approve baseline, computed forecast);
  `/planner/*`; web `/planner/plan` (PL-3/4/5).
- **P1-D/E/F** — `models/classroom.py` (lesson_logs, homework_assignments/checks);
  `ClassroomService` (My Day, quick log, homework + guardian-notify stub, compliance);
  `notify_guardian.py` (WhatsApp console stub); `/classroom/*`; web `/classroom` (My Day, CL-1/2/3)
  + `/classroom/compliance` (CL-4).

Demo logins (all `demo1234`): `kc@` (director), `priya@` (coordinator), `ramesh@`/`anil@` (teachers)
— all `@demo.trackbit.app`.

- **P1.5** — `models/sessions.py` (sessions, session_students, session_meetings, session_attendance;
  migration `d7d8e9fab0c1`); `SessionService`; `/sessions/*`; web `/sessions` (SS-1) +
  `/sessions/[id]` (SS-2 tap-capture + one batch photo).
- **P2** — Director Dashboard (M4): `services/dashboard.py` composes planner forecast + fees + session
  records + classroom compliance/homework + weak-subject trends into a RAG board + alert feed;
  one-tap **alert→task**; Monday **digest** preview. `/dashboard/*` (fee card director-only, §3.3);
  web `/insights`. Board templates (Maintenance/Housekeeping) ship via seed (§5.5).
- **P3** — Assessments & Bands (M3): `models/assessments.py` (skill_areas, assessment_cycles,
  assessment_scores, student_bands, interventions, intervention_items; migration `d8e9fab0c1d2`);
  `AssessmentService` (skill areas, cycles, score grid + verify, band suggestion + append-only set +
  history, skill profile, subject trends + weak detection, interventions that spawn M5 tasks and
  track completion); `/assessments/*`; web `/assessments` (scores grid / bands / trends tabs) + skill
  areas on `/academics`. Weak-subject alerts feed the dashboard. Migration head **`d8e9fab0c1d2`**.

**All product phases P0–P3 are complete** (11 migrations, 163 tests). **Deferred items:** the
*fees-mode* xlsx import; scheduled background jobs (4 pm unlogged reminder, Saturday guardian summary,
Monday digest *delivery* — builders/previews exist, cron wiring does not); PL-6 day-celebration
suggestions + `day_catalog`; the DB-3 teacher growth profile (v1.5). See SPRD §10.

## How this repo was bootstrapped (background)

Per SPRD §2.4 (packet **P0-A**) the app was **seeded from two sibling projects** (not inside this
folder):

- **`../task_management2/`** — the **SEED** copied into `api/` + `web/`. Its `CLAUDE.md` and its six
  architectural laws (below) govern **all** code here. **Read `../task_management2/CLAUDE.md`
  before writing backend code.** Stack: FastAPI + **sync** SQLAlchemy 2 + PostgreSQL (two DB
  roles + RLS), event-sourced tasks, APScheduler, channel-adapter notifications, magic-link auth,
  Next.js 16 + React 19 + Tailwind v4.
- **`../fee_management_system/`** — the fee module, **PORTED not mounted** (it's an older async /
  JWT / workspace-tenancy generation). Port its money domain nearly verbatim; see its `CLAUDE.md`
  and SPRD §4.6/§5.6 for the behavioral invariants. The real school registers to test the xlsx
  importer against are `shana_fee.xlsx` / `shana_extra_fee.xlsx` in that folder.

Legacy — **never copy from these:** `../task_management/` (old), `../school_ops*`. The old
`fee_management_system` stays live as the school's working tool until the unified app reaches fee
parity (SPRD §5.6 checklist).

### Layout

```
api/    ← FastAPI backend (+ academics/students; sessions/assessments/dashboard/fees to come)
web/    ← Next.js frontend (new IA per SPRD §6.2 as modules land)
docs/   ← the four spec docs
```

## Commands

Backend, from `api/` (Python 3.12, **uv** — not pip/poetry):

```bash
uv sync --extra dev                          # install deps
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --port 8000      # run API (NO --reload; restart after edits)
uv run pytest -q                             # full suite
uv run pytest tests/test_master_data.py::test_name   # single test
uv run ruff check app tests                  # lint (--fix to auto-fix)
uv run alembic upgrade head                  # migrations
uv run python -m scripts.seed                # demo data (login kc@demo.trackbit.app / demo1234)
```

Frontend, from `web/` (Node 20+): `npm run dev` (needs API up), `npm run build`, `npm run lint`,
`npx tsc --noEmit`. Env: only `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` (must end in `/api/v1`).

**Packet Done-when gate:** backend packets end green on `uv run pytest -q` + `ruff`; frontend packets
end green on `npx tsc --noEmit` + `eslint` + `next build`. The **full backend suite (currently 130) is
the regression gate** — it must stay green after every change.

### Local dev database (validated setup)

Tests/Alembic need **real PostgreSQL** (no SQLite fallback) with the two-role RLS setup. `api/.env`
is a template pointing at a to-be-created Aiven `trackbit_school_db` (SPRD §2.4 — do **not** reuse the
seed's `trackbit_db`). For local dev, the seed's `docker-compose.yml` gives you Postgres on `:5434`:

```bash
# from api/
docker compose up -d db                       # postgres 16 on localhost:5434 (user/pw/db: trackbit)
# one-time: a restricted, NOBYPASSRLS app role so RLS actually applies (test_rls needs this)
docker exec -i trackbit_db psql -U trackbit -d trackbit_test -c \
  "CREATE ROLE trackbit_app LOGIN PASSWORD 'apppass' NOSUPERUSER NOBYPASSRLS; \
   GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO trackbit_app; \
   GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO trackbit_app; \
   GRANT USAGE,SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO trackbit_app; \
   ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE ON TABLES TO trackbit_app;"
# then run with the app role for DATABASE_URL and the owner for migrations:
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql+psycopg2://trackbit_app:apppass@localhost:5434/trackbit_test"
export ADMIN_DATABASE_URL="postgresql+psycopg2://trackbit:trackbit@localhost:5434/trackbit_test"
uv run alembic upgrade head && uv run pytest -q
```

(Grants must be re-run only if migrations add tables *before* those tables have rows the app touches;
`ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` covers new tables created afterward.)

## Six architectural laws (load-bearing — carry into all new tables/endpoints)

1. **`org_id` comes only from the verified token**, never from params/body. Every authed handler
   reads `member.org_id` via `get_current_member` / `require_admin`.
2. **Two DB roles + Row-Level Security.** App connects as a restricted role (no BYPASSRLS); app-layer
   org scoping is the primary guard, RLS is defense-in-depth. Always scope queries by `org_id`
   explicitly anyway. Every new table gets an org-isolation RLS policy.
3. **Append-only history, never overwrite.** Task state via `append_event` (event-sourced). This
   spirit extends to all new "who did it" data: band changes, plan approvals, score verifications,
   and fee `transactions` are **append rows** (undo = compensating row, never a delete/UPDATE).
4. **Template vs Instance.** `TaskTemplate` = recurring definitions only; `TaskInstance` = every
   concrete unit (one-time tasks have `template_id = NULL`). Recurring instances are materialized
   ahead of time by the background job, guarded by a `(template_id, occurrence_date)` unique index.
5. **Visibility is centralized** in `core/visibility.py`; endpoints never inline access checks.
   Deliberate rule: **admins do NOT see private boards** they aren't members of.
6. **Thin endpoints, fat services.** Endpoints do plumbing only; logic lives in `services/`. Raise
   `AppError` subclasses (→ `{ "error": { code, message, details } }` envelope), never
   `HTTPException`, for business errors.

## Five product principles (acceptance criteria, not slogans)

- **P1 — One-minute teacher budget.** ≤ ~1 min/day capture per teacher; measured in taps and seconds
  on every teacher screen (quick-log ≤ 3 taps / ≤ 25s; 15-student session ≤ 60s). Feature over
  budget → redesign or cut.
- **P2 — Plan is baseline, log is actual.** The approved plan is locked; re-forecast is **computed**
  from baseline + logs + remaining effective periods — never stored as mutated plan rows.
- **P3 — Teachers get value before they give data** (logging homework auto-notifies parents).
- **P4 — Bands (A/B/C) are private intervention tiers, never labels.** Staff-only; **never** appear on
  any parent/guardian-facing surface (message, report, anything).
- **P5 — Nobody writes a report.** Every report is a byproduct of doing the work, captured at the
  moment with evidence (a tap, a count, a batch photo — never per-student photos).

## Roles & hard rules

Roles extend the seed's admin/member: `admin` (Director) · `coordinator` · `teacher` · `office`
(existing `member` → `teacher` on migration). New deps: `require_coordinator_up`, `require_academic`,
`require_office_up`. Permissions are backend-enforced (SPRD §3.3), UI mirrors. Non-negotiable:
**teachers never see fees; office never sees academic data; band tiers never reach parents.**
Parents have **no login** in v1 — guardians are records that receive outbound notifications only.

## AI services & stubs

All AI lives in `app/services/ai/`, is a single internal client, and is **env-gated** — when keys are
unset it returns deterministic fixtures so every flow is testable offline. Same pattern as the seed's
integrations (email/R2/billing/push stub when keys blank). **No chat UI** — AI is invisible plumbing
(plan drafts, celebration drafts, syllabus split, xlsx/photo parsing), and **every AI output lands in
a human-confirm surface before persisting** (editable drafts, verify grids). Model ids come from env
(`AI_MODEL_DRAFT`, `AI_MODEL_PARSE`); use current Claude models per the claude-api skill.

## Fences — do NOT build (SPRD §11 / arch §8, binding)

No timetable generator (periods/week is entered data, never generated) · no school-wide attendance
registers (M2 Sessions are teacher-run classes only, not registers) · no test authoring/conducting
(TrackBit records the school's own paper tests) · no parent app/login · no chatbot/AI-orchestrator
UI · no per-student evidence photos (batch only) · no visitor/inventory/social/health modules · no
report-card designer. LMS + teacher training belong to a separate product (Playground). If a school
asks for these, the answer is "we work alongside your ERP," not a rebuild.

## Build order

Work **packet-by-packet** per SPRD §10; do not mark a packet done until its **Done-when** criteria
pass. Sequence: **P0** foundation (bootstrap → roles → master data → fee port) → **P1** Planner +
Classroom Log (the make-or-break phase: are teachers still logging in week 4?) → **P1.5** Sessions →
**P2** Dashboard + digest → **P3** Assessments & Bands. Growth profiles and WhatsApp capture are
v1.5. The core loop: **M1 sets the plan → M2 records reality → M3/M4 detect gaps → M5 assigns the
response → M4 shows whether it worked.**
